# weather_prediction
This Python script is designed for the analysis of weather data and the prediction of maximum temperatures for the next day. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

1. Introduction:
This Python script is designed for the analysis of weather data and the prediction of maximum temperatures for the next day. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

2. Data Loading and Initial Inspection:
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-Learn for machine learning.
It loads a weather dataset from a CSV file named "dfw_weather.csv" and sets the "DATE" column as the index of the DataFrame.

3. Handling Missing Values:
Missing data can significantly impact machine learning models. To address this, the script calculates and displays the percentage of missing values in each column of the dataset using the `pd.isnull` function.
A subset of core columns is selected from the dataset, namely "PRCP," "SNOW," "SNWD," "TMAX," and "TMIN," and they are renamed for simplicity.
Columns with a high number of missing values, such as "snow" and "snow_depth," are removed using the `del` statement.
Missing values in the "prec" (precipitation) column are filled with zeros to ensure the data remains usable.

4. Data Transformation and Visualization:
The script converts the index of the DataFrame to a datetime format, assuming that it represents dates.
It calculates the rolling mean of daily maximum temperature ("max_temp") over a 30-day window and stores it in a new column named "month_max."
Missing values in the "month_max" column are replaced with a special NA value, `pd.NA`.
Data types of columns are printed using the `core_values.dtypes` attribute.

5. Model Building and Prediction:
A Ridge regression model is employed to predict the "max_temp" for the next day ("target").
The predictors used for training the model are "prec," "max_temp," and "min_temp."
The dataset is split into training and test sets based on a specific date ("2020-12-31").
The model is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test data.
The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted and actual temperatures is calculated using the `mean_absolute_error` function.
A DataFrame named "combined" is created to store actual and predicted values.

6. Feature Engineering:
The script calculates two additional features:
 "month_day_max": The ratio between the daily maximum temperature and the monthly mean temperature.
"max_min": The ratio between the maximum and minimum temperatures for each day.

7. Further Data Imputation:
Missing values in the selected predictor columns are filled with the respective column means. This ensures that the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.

8. Grouping and Aggregating Data:
The script groups and aggregates data in two ways:
 It calculates the expanding mean of "max_temp" grouped by month and stores the result in the "mon_avg" column.
It calculates the expanding mean of "max_temp" grouped by the day of the year and stores the result in the "day_of_year_avg" column.

9. Model Evaluation and Output:
The script prints the MAE error, providing insight into the model's accuracy.
The Ridge regression coefficients are displayed, indicating the importance of each feature.
Correlations between the "target" (predicted temperature) and other features are calculated and stored in the "correlations" variable, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.

10. Conclusion:
This script provides a comprehensive pipeline for weather data analysis and temperature prediction. It covers data loading, handling missing values, data transformation, model building and evaluation, feature engineering, and further data imputation. The Ridge regression model serves as a baseline for temperature prediction, and additional analysis can be performed based on the results obtained.
